        question: "How do typing competitions work?",
        answer: "Competitions start when enough participants join or at scheduled times. All participants type the same text simultaneously, and rankings are updated in real-time based on speed and accuracy. The winner is typically determined by the highest WPM with good accuracy."
      },
      {
        question: "What's a good WPM for competitions?",
        answer: "Beginner competitions: 20-40 WPM, Intermediate: 40-60 WPM, Advanced: 60+ WPM. Professional typists often exceed 80 WPM. Focus on accuracy first, then build speed - most competitions penalize errors."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I create private competitions?",
        answer: "Yes, you can create private typing rooms for your team, classroom, or friends. Share the room code with participants to join your exclusive competition."
      },
      {
        question: "How is accuracy calculated in competitions?",
        answer: "Accuracy is calculated as (correct characters / total characters typed) Ã— 100. Most competitions require minimum accuracy (usually 85-95%) to qualify for rankings, encouraging quality over pure speed."
