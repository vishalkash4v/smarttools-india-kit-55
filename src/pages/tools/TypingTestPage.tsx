        question: "What's considered a good typing speed?",
        answer: "Average typing speed is 35-40 WPM. Good typists achieve 50-70 WPM, while professional typists often exceed 80 WPM. Focus on accuracy first - it's better to type 40 WPM accurately than 60 WPM with many errors."
      },
      {
        question: "How is WPM calculated?",
        answer: "WPM (Words Per Minute) is calculated as (characters typed รท 5) รท minutes. We use the standard formula where 5 characters (including spaces) equal one word, providing consistent measurements across different texts."
      },
      {
        question: "Should I focus on speed or accuracy?",
        answer: "Always prioritize accuracy over speed. Typing fast with errors is counterproductive as you'll need to spend time correcting mistakes. Build accuracy first, then gradually increase speed - this approach leads to better long-term results."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I take typing tests?",
        answer: "Take typing tests weekly to track progress, but don't test daily as it can become discouraging. Spend most of your time practicing proper technique and building muscle memory through consistent typing exercises."
