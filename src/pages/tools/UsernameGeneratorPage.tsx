        question: "Can I check if a username is available?",

        question: "Should I include numbers and symbols?",
        answer: "Numbers and symbols can make usernames more unique and available, but they can also make them harder to remember and type. Consider your use case and platform requirements."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I generate usernames for business use?",
        answer: "Yes, you can use this tool for business usernames too. Consider using your business name as the base and choose professional-sounding combinations."
