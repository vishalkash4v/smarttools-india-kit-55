      question: "What is SIP and how does it work?",
      answer: "SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is a method of investing in mutual funds where you invest a fixed amount regularly (monthly/quarterly). It helps average out market volatility and builds wealth through compound growth over time."
    },
    {
      question: "What should be the expected return rate for SIP?",
      answer: "Historically, equity mutual funds have delivered 10-15% annual returns over long periods. However, returns can vary based on market conditions and fund performance. It's advisable to use conservative estimates for planning."
    },
    {
      question: "Is SIP better than lump sum investment?",
      answer: "SIP is generally better for regular investors as it provides rupee cost averaging, reduces timing risk, and instills investment discipline. Lump sum can be better when markets are at low levels and you have surplus funds."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are these SIP calculations?",
      answer: "Our calculator provides accurate mathematical projections based on your inputs. However, actual returns may vary due to market conditions, fund performance, and economic factors. Use these as estimates for planning."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I increase my SIP amount over time?",
      answer: "Yes, you can increase your SIP amount annually (called step-up SIP) to account for salary increases and inflation. Many fund houses offer automatic step-up options of 5-10% annually."
